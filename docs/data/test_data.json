          "value": "GB.1859.1 was a large, adult Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) of unknown sex killed on Bear Mountain or the Bear or Hogback Mountains approximately three miles San Andreas, California by a party of two unnamed hunters on or about 18 November, 1859. It is likely that GB.1859.1 weighed over one thousand pounds when slaughtered for meat and gallbladder, adding credence to the inference that this Bear was likely an adult in fair or good health at the time of its death. The killing of GB.1859.1 and the sale of GB.1859.1's meat was notable to the Californian press both for its size and for the sale of Bear Gall or gallbladder to unnamed members of the Chinese community (likely emigrants and labourers) in an unnamed location, likely, Calaveras County or San Francisco. GB.1859.1's microhistory should be considered in conjunction with the history of the California Grizzly, a now-extirpated population local to this region at this time. GB.1859.1 was killed during the Winter Rest Period, or torpor sleep period colloquially referred to as “hibernation,” and adjacent sources (see TR.1859.1) refer to the presence of Grizzly dens in this area, as well as to mining prospectors (among them, Mark McNicholas). GB.1859.1 lived on the Territories of the Miwok (Miwuk; Mi-Wuk; Me-Wuk) People, and may have been denning in a nearby gulch. The identities of the two hunters are not presently known. It is likely that snowfall in the mountains made the tracking of GB.1859.1 more feasible, and noted that a mild winter contributed to the presence of wild ruminants at lower elevations adjacent to town than typical for the season (the implication being that bears often followed).
