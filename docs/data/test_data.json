          "value": "GB.1859.1 was a large, adult Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) of unknown sex killed on Bear Mountain or the Bear or Hogback Mountains approximately three miles San Andreas, California by a party of two unnamed hunters on or about 18 November, 1859. It is likely that GB.1859.1 weighed over one thousand pounds when slaughtered for meat and gallbladder, adding credence to the inference that this Bear was likely an adult in fair or good health at the time of its death. The killing of GB.1859.1 and the sale of GB.1859.1's meat was notable to the Californian press both for its size and for the sale of Bear Gall or gallbladder to unnamed members of the Chinese community (likely emigrants and labourers) in an unnamed location, likely, Calaveras County or San Francisco. GB.1859.1's microhistory should be considered in conjunction with the history of the California Grizzly, a now-extirpated population local to this region at this time. GB.1859.1 was killed during the Winter Rest Period, or torpor sleep period colloquially referred to as “hibernation,” and adjacent sources (see TR.1859.1) refer to the presence of Grizzly dens in this area, as well as to mining prospectors (among them, Mark McNicholas). GB.1859.1 lived on the Territories of the Miwok (Miwuk; Mi-Wuk; Me-Wuk) People, and may have been denning in a nearby gulch. The identities of the two hunters are not presently known. It is likely that snowfall in the mountains made the tracking of GB.1859.1 more feasible, and noted that a mild winter contributed to the presence of wild ruminants at lower elevations adjacent to town than typical for the season (the implication being that bears often followed).

          "value": "GB.1859.3 was a large, likely adult male Grizzly Bear of unknown weight or length. GB.1859.3 was shot and killed under unknown circumstances on Tuesday, 8 November 1859 on the outskirts of Oakland, California, possibly in the Oakland Hills. GB.1859.3 was killed within the plausible bounds of the Winter Rest Period colloquially referred to as “Hibernation,” and the factors which resulted in this bear’s death or motivation for its killing are unknown. The status of GB.1859.3’s health upon his death is unknown from available resources, but basis exists to consider that the overall condition of this Bear may plausibly be presumed to have been good: GB.1859.3’s carcass was brought to San Francisco and sold, likely, for meat. It is likely that GB.1859.3 was killed by settlers, and given regional history, it is possible that GB.1859.3’s killing involved the ranching industry. GB.1859.3’s story appears in two print sources specific to California, both of which can be accessed through the California Digital Newspaper Collection (CDNC). Available geolocational context in these microhistories suggest that GB.1859.3’s killing is likely to have occurred on the land of one or more of the following Indigenous Communities: the Ohlone Peoples, the Muwékma Ohlone Tribe, the Miwok, the Me-Wuk (Bay Miwok), and the Confederated Villages of Lisjan. The timing and location of GB.1859.3’s microhistory suggests the possibility that this Bear’s history should be considered in the context of the history of the California Grizzly, a subspecies considered extinct. GB.1859.3’s microhistory reveals the history of another Bear, also stated to be a Grizzly, GB.1859.3A.
